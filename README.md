# Lazy Farmer

Lazy Farmer is a game made for the [Godot XR Game Jam July 2024](https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024). The gameplay consists of grabbing the farmer and placing it on top of plots of farmland so it can plant. Once the crop is ready to be harvested, you place the farmer on top again, and it will harvest it. You can also collect eggs laid out by hens.

Play on itch: [https://decacis.itch.io/lazy-farmer](https://decacis.itch.io/lazy-farmer)

Made using Godot 4.3-beta2

**NOTE:** due to licensing issues, I cannot include the two songs used in the game in this repository. However, you can download them from [here](https://www.zapsplat.com/music/tiny-town-warm-and-sincere-music-with-acoustic-guitar-rhythm-and-piano/) and [here](https://www.zapsplat.com/music/bluegrass-billy-a-simple-fun-and-carefree-track-with-bluegrass-banjo-melody-upright-bass-drums-and-hand-claps/) and just place the files inside `res://assets/music/`

**ANOTHER NOTE:** you have to add the OpenXR Vendors plugin (v3.0.0 recommended) and Godot Jolt (version 0.13.0-beta1 recommended).
